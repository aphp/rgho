## Resubmission
This is a resubmission, after the package has been removed from CRAN for policy violation.
In this version, I have fixed the issue.

* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran, solaris-patched

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs, 1 NOTE :
  Package was archived on CRAN
  
  CRAN repository db overrides:
    X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2021-11-12 for repeated policy violation.
