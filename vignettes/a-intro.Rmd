```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(rgho)
```

`rgho` is an `R` package to access [WHO GHO data](http://www.who.int/gho/en/) from R via the Athena web service, an API providing a simple query interface to the World Health Organization's data and statistics content.

## The Global Health Observatory

As stated by the WHO website: *The GHO data repository contains an extensive list of indicators, which can be selected by theme or through a multi-dimension query functionality. It is the World Health Organization's main health statistics repository*.

## Data structure

GHO data is composed of indicators structured in dimensions. The list of dimensions is available in `vignette("b-dimensions", "rgho")`, the list of indicators for the *GHO* dimension (the main dimension) in `vignette("c-codes-gho", "rgho")`).

It is possible to access dimensions with `get_gho_dimensions()`:

```{r}
get_gho_dimensions()
```

And codes for a given dimension with `get_gho_codes()`:

```{r}
get_gho_codes(dimension = "COUNTRY")
get_gho_codes(dimension = "GHO")
```

## Search

The function `search_dimensions()` and `search_codes()` research a term in dimension or codes labels, respectively.

```{r}
search_dimensions("region")
search_codes("neonatal", dimension = "GHO")
```

It is also possible to search results from an existing object.

```{r}
result <- get_gho_codes(dimension = "REGION")
search_gho(result, "asia")
```

## Filtering results

Dimension codes can be filtered according to their attributes.

```{r}
results <- get_gho_codes(dimension = "COUNTRY")

filter_attrs(
  results,
  WHO_REGION_CODE == "EUR"
)
```

Attribute values can be displayed.

```{r}
values_attrs(
  results,
  "WHO_REGION_CODE"
)
```

## Data download

An indicator can be downloaded as a `data_frame` with `get_gho_data()`. Here we use `MDG_0000000001`, *Infant mortality rate (probability of dying between birth and age 1 per 1000 live births)*:

```{r}
result <- get_gho_data(
  dimension = "GHO",
  code = "MDG_0000000001"
)

print(result, width = Inf)
```

## Filter requests

The `filter` argument in `get_gho_data()` allows request filtering:

```{r}
result <- get_gho_data(
  dimension = "GHO",
  code = "MDG_0000000001",
  filter = list(
    REGION = "EUR",
    YEAR = "2015"
  )
)

print(result, width = Inf)
```

## Other parameters

Other parameters than `format` can be specified to `get_gho_data()` (such as `apikey`, `asof`...). Parameters are listed on [this page](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.resources.api). Note that most parameters are not available to general users.

For details about how the requests are performed and the option availables see `vignette("e-details", "rgho")`.
