```

`rgho` is an `R` package to access [WHO GHO data](https://www.who.int/data/gho/) from R via the GHO OData API, providing a simple query interface to the World Health Organization's data and statistics content.

## The Global Health Observatory

As stated by the WHO website: *The GHO data repository contains an extensive list of indicators, which can be selected by theme or through a multi-dimension query functionality. It is the World Health Organization's main health statistics repository*.

## Data structure

GHO data is composed of indicators structured in dimensions. The list of dimensions is available in `vignette("b-dimensions", "rgho")`, the list of indicators for the *GHO* dimension (the main dimension) in `vignette("c-values-gho", "rgho")`).

It is possible to access dimensions with `get_gho_dimensions()`:

```{r}
get_gho_dimensions()
```

And codes for a given dimension with `get_gho_values()`:

```{r}
get_gho_values(dimension = "COUNTRY")
get_gho_values(dimension = "GHO")
```

## Search

The function `search_dimensions()` and `search_values()` research a term in dimension or codes labels, respectively.

```{r}
search_dimensions("region")
search_values("neonatal", dimension = "GHO")
```

It is also possible to search results from an existing object.

```{r}
result <- get_gho_values(dimension = "REGION")
search_gho(result, "asia")
```
## Data download

An indicator can be downloaded as a `data_frame` with `get_gho_data()`. Here we use `MDG_0000000001`, *Infant mortality rate (probability of dying between birth and age 1 per 1000 live births)*:

```{r}
result <- get_gho_data(
  code = "MDG_0000000001"
)

print(result)
```

## Filter requests

The `filter` argument in `get_gho_data()` allows request filtering:

```{r}
result <- get_gho_data(
  code = "MDG_0000000001",
  filter = list(
    REGION = "EUR",
    YEAR = 2015
  )
)

print(result)
```

## Other parameters

For details about how the requests are performed and the options available (especially proxy settings) see `vignette("e-details", "rgho")`.
